TODO
Sort the sales by date
toast dismiss on tap
search items only in home tab
sales pagination
<any>? in MatTableDataSource
progress bar for paidValue?
rethink the selectedItems logic(specially after changing sidePanel for first tab)

DONE
update sales(for tab SalesHistoric) once the tab is opened
FIX: after removing item from shopingcart with "-" button, the sale is not generated. S: clearSale (null id)
